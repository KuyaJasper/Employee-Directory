# Development

This application was created using [React](https://reactjs.org/). For styling I used [Bootstrap V5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)

For the employee informaiton, the API was provided to use in the homework requirements using the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/)

# Acceptance Criteria

```
* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
```
